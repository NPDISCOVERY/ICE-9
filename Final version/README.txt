-- ICE-9 --
Here it is, the infamous ICE-9 spyware. 
I found it also on the Interweebz (call me a skid), but it was a really really bad code and 
I had to correct many many MANY errors in it, and there's some again. This source code will also won't 
work since it has to be put with an Visual Basic application stuff, that I totally will not reveal. 
Probably in the future though. 

I. Timeline 
ICE-9 project started some times around in January 2017. I had no idea on why DP wanted to spy on LS and
Wene before, but I do wanted to know a lot more about them. So we allied. ICE-9 was succesfully tested 
around May. We tested it on a Windows XP virtual computer, and it indeed worked. By the way, zero 
victim of ICE-9 has been recorded.

II. How the fuck ICE-9 works
ICE-9 is a keylogger sending keystrokes with SMTP protocol. It also don't use any exploits or 
other tools. It sends keystrokes via email, and thus logs
with whatever account you got, create an email, send it to whatever guy you want. Eh, it could make a 
good email bomber. 

III. Did it worked?
Hell no.

a)ICE-9's flaw
ICE-9's first flaw was the Operating System. It worked only on Windows XP and Windows 7 (tested).
Plus, I didn't made ICE-9 persistent, you could've just killed it on the Task Managed and you can just
kill it definitely. I didn't had enough Visual Basic "skillz" for making it persistent or whatever. 

IV. That's it?
Yes. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less.
